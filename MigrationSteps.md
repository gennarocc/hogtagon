# Migrating to Server-Authoritative HogController

## Current Changes Made
- Enhanced `HogController.cs` with:
  - Server authority configuration
  - Direct steering input implementation
  - State synchronization between server and clients
  - Improved input handling with buffering and smoothing

## Next Steps in Unity Editor

### 1. Update Player Prefab Hierarchy
The Player prefab needs to be updated to match the structure used by the ClientAuthoritativePlayer prefab:

- Select the `Player` prefab in the Project window
- Ensure the Rigidbody component is on the root GameObject
  - If not, remove it from its current location and add it to the root
  - Copy all property values from the original Rigidbody
- HogController component should be on the same GameObject as the Rigidbody
  - Add the HogController component to the root object
  - Remove any existing NetworkHogController component

### 2. Configure HogController Component
- Set appropriate values for the new serialized fields:
  - `steeringBufferSize`: 5 (recommended)
  - `minDeadzone`: 3.0
  - `maxDeadzone`: 10.0
  - `maxSpeedForSteering`: 20.0
  - `minSteeringResponse`: 0.6
  - `maxSteeringResponse`: 1.0
  - `inputWeightingMethod`: Linear
  - `weightingFactor`: 1.0
  - `serverValidationThreshold`: 5.0
  - `clientUpdateInterval`: 0.05
  - `stateUpdateInterval`: 0.1
  - `visualSmoothingSpeed`: 10.0

### 3. Set References in HogController
Copy all references from the old NetworkHogController to the new HogController:
- Wheel Colliders
- Wheel Transforms
- Particle Systems
- Trail Renderers
- Explosion GameObject
- Jump Particle Systems
- Audio references
- Any other serialized references

### 4. Update Script References
- Make sure all script references in the prefab are correct:
  - Replace any references to `NetworkHogController` with `HogController`
  - Ensure wheel colliders and mesh references are correctly assigned
  - Verify particle system references are set

### 5. Test Configuration
- Enter Play mode and verify:
  - Vehicle controls respond appropriately
  - Network synchronization works correctly
  - Visual effects display properly
  - Jump functionality works correctly
  - Audio plays properly

## Important Changes to Player.cs
- The `Player.cs` script has already been updated to reference the `HogController` component instead of `NetworkHogController`
- No further changes to the script are needed at this time

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Vehicle movement/steering is responsive
- [ ] Vehicle syncs properly over network
- [ ] Jump effect works correctly
- [ ] Particle effects display properly
- [ ] Audio plays correctly
- [ ] No console errors related to missing references
- [ ] Player interactions with other game systems work as expected

## Key Benefits of This Migration
1. **Server Authority**: Improved security against cheating
2. **Improved Handling**: Direct steering provides more responsive control
3. **Smoother Experience**: Input buffering and state synchronization reduce perceived lag
4. **Simplified Hierarchy**: Consistent structure between different player types
5. **Code Consolidation**: Single controller class handles both local and networked behavior

## Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Missing References**: If the controller can't find references, ensure all serialized fields are properly assigned
2. **Network Sync Issues**: Check server validation threshold and update intervals
3. **Visual Glitches**: Ensure particle systems and visual effects are properly referenced
4. **Input Responsiveness**: Adjust steering input smoothing parameters
5. **Physics Behavior**: Match the Rigidbody settings from the original prefab

## Notes
- If visual effects don't appear correctly, check that the particle system references are properly set in the HogController component
- Make sure RPCs in the HogController are properly set up with RequireOwnership flags
- The server validation threshold can be adjusted based on network conditions - lower values provide tighter synchronization but may cause more corrections
